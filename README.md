# NodeRelationshipsLLM
This project showcases how to leverage OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model and Pinecone, a vector database, to discover hidden relationships within complex datasets. We organize our data using the Neo4j graph database and visualize the intricate connections using Gemini Explore. The demonstrated example uses a movie dataset, but the methodology is adaptable to various data types with minor modifications. Dive in to learn about uncovering and understanding hidden data relationships in a user-friendly and visual way.
